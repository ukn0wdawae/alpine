--putStrLn takes a string and returns an I/O action that has a result type of () (i.e. the empty tuple, also known as "unit")

--main always has a type signature of main :: IO something, where something is some concrete type. By convention, we don't usually specify a type declaration for main
main = do  
    putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"  
    name <- getLine  
    putStrLn ("Hey " ++ name ++ ", you rock!") 

-- ghci> :t getLine  
-- getLine :: IO String


--in a do block, the last action cannot be bound to a name like the first two were
main = do  
    foo <- putStrLn "Hello, what's your name?"  
    name <- getLine  
    putStrLn ("Hey " ++ name ++ ", you rock!") 

--use <- when you want to bind results of I/O actions to names and you can use let bindings to bind pure expressions to names
main = do  
    putStrLn "What's your first name?"  
    firstName <- getLine  
    putStrLn "What's your last name?"  
    lastName <- getLine  
    let bigFirstName = map toUpper firstName  
        bigLastName = map toUpper lastName  
    putStrLn $ "hey " ++ bigFirstName ++ " " ++ bigLastName ++ ", how are you?"  

--a program that continuously reads a line and prints out the same line with the words reversed. The program's execution will stop when we input a blank line.

    line <- getLine  
    return "BLAH BLAH BLAH"

--return is sort of the opposite to <-. While return takes a value and wraps it up in a box, <- takes a box (and performs it) and takes the value out of it, binding it to a name.

-- IOMode type 
data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode  

import System.IO  

-- Io mode returns an I/O action that will open the specified file in the specified mode. If we bind that action to something we get a Handle. A value of type Handle represents where our file is. We'll use that handle so we know which file to read from. It would be stupid to read a file but not bind that read to a handle because we wouldn't be able to do anything with the file. So in our case, we bound the handle to handle.
-- hGetContents. It takes a Handle, so it knows which file to get the contents from and returns an IO String â€” an I/O action that holds as its result the contents of the file. This function is pretty much like getContents.The only difference is that getContents will automatically read from the standard input (that is from the terminal), whereas hGetContents takes a file handle which tells it which file to read from.
--With putStr contents we just print the contents out to the standard output and then we do hClose, which takes a handle and returns an I/O action that closes the file. You have to close the file yourself after opening it with openFile!

--hSetBuffering function. It takes a handle and a BufferMode and returns an I/O action that sets the buffering. BufferMode is a simple enumeration data type and the possible values it can hold are: NoBuffering, LineBuffering or BlockBuffering (Maybe Int). The Maybe Int is for how big the chunk should be, in bytes. If it's Nothing, then the operating system determines the chunk size. NoBuffering means that it will be read one character at a time. NoBuffering usually sucks as a buffering mode because it has to access the disk so much.
